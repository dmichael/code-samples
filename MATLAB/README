MATLAB

These are some raw MATLAB files from my thesis project. It has been a few years since I have looked through them and I am not sure if the collection is complete, but they are all documented. The program, when run, created a population of genotypes describing a syrinx and stimulated each one with a spiking pattern generated by a neural network. The results are saved as an audio file and then imported and compared to a target which generates an error measurement by which to judge the results in comparison with the target. The process is repeated until a complete match is found.

evolutionarySongbird.m is the main file with the genetic algorithms and other support code.

izhikevichEuler.m is an implementation of the Izhikevich model neuron using Euler integration.
