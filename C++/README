C++

These are example C++ files originally coded as part of a realtime audio framework extended for use with Ruby.

The file Marionette.cpp is intended to be a Singleton class (though not implemented as one) to manage the creation of audio objects, adding them to the master Bus, and processing from the main callback function.

I have also included an implementation of the Observer pattern, also used in the framework. It is really intended to be Observable Observers.

There are other C++ files browsable at http://github.com/dmichael/marionette and in the Ruby folder (/Ruby/extensions)
