Ruby
====================

This is the language that I have been working in professinally for the past few years. Included is one file from my personal project simulating frogs and toads (anuran.rb), examples of the "externals" I have written for Ruby using C++ in the extensions folder, and a class that interfaces with the serial port (USB) using the external ruby-serialport which is ultimately run in a thread in a host application.

For more code examples in Ruby, including a class for using Oracle Stored Procedures in Ruby on Rails and a server for handling long running uploads, please visit
